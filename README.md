# Custom String Class C++

A custom string class made using C++. Uses cstring functions along with raw char* member named buffer to build up a string class. Class implements Constructor, Destructor, Deep Copy, Copy Assignment, operator+, and printing via ostream& operator<<.

I am currently trying to learn modern c++ move semantics and will look to implement move construtor and move assignment operator in the near future.

I might also look to implement error handling in the future.
